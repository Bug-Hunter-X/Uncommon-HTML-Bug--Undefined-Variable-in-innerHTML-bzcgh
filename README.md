This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to using innerHTML with variables that may be undefined. The bug occurs when attempting to set the innerHTML property of an element to a variable that hasn't been assigned a value, resulting in unexpected behavior. The solution provides a way to handle this by checking if the variable has a value before using it with innerHTML. This helps prevent empty divs and ensures the HTML displays as expected.
